CoDA groups need the least possible organization that can accomplish our service responsibilities. We are organized through our service structure. We rely upon the spiritual leadership of a loving Higher Power as expressed through the group conscience at all service levels, as opposed to rigid organization. Positions of leadership need to be regularly rotated. By doing so, we welcome the active flow of new ideas and energy to service. Our service structure consists of volunteers from the Fellowship who act in CoDAâ€™s best interests by reflecting the group conscience of CoDA as a whole. All CODA members have an opportunity to offer service as a vital part of their recovery.
