Our First Tradition reminds us that without the strength of our CODA Fellowship, we do not recover on our own; CoDA's existence depends on CODA unity. We need the continuity of our common bonds, such as literature, meeting format, the Steps, the Traditions and recovery tools and concepts. We come together, in unity, to help each other recognize that we are not alone in our recovery. Each member is a unique part of a greater whole. We value every individual's experience, strength and hope.
