In CODA our ultimate authority comes from a power greater than ourselves. We call this power our 'group conscience.'' A group conscience is the collective expression of every member's loving Higher Power. The group conscience provides guidance for all CoDA groups in an atmosphere of safety, respect and acceptance. No individual is an authority in a CODA group. At all levels of service, members are responsible to carry out the decisions made through the group conscience process.
