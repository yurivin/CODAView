Anonymity has profound spiritual value. Since we focus  on building  self  worth,  we  cannot  afford  personal  quests  for power  or  prestige.  We  are  constantly  reminded  to  look beyond our egos and personalities toward the higher issues of recover. Anonymity challenges us to practice true humility and reminds us that  the principles of the CoDA program transcend any individual.
