CoDA groups do no use the CoDA name to promote or support any outside author or written material, organisations, therapy, religion, political group, charity, business or financial enterprise. When we use any facility for meetings or events, we pay for its use, implying no affiliation. We actively protect ourselves from matters that might otherwise divert us from our main spiritual goal; recovery from codependency.
