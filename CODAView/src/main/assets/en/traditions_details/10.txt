Our  sole  purpose  is  recovery  from  codependency  working the delve Steps and twelve through Traditions. CoDA groups and  members  refrain  from  linking  opinions  on  any  outside issue or organization, including politics, religion,  other selfhelp  groups,  therapeutic  concepts,  recovery  centres, businesses,  literature  or  causes.  If  we  identify  ourselves  as members  of  the  fellowship,  then  we  remain  neutral  on  all pubic matters. We have no authority to speak for CODA as a whole, and we disengage from controversial issues.
