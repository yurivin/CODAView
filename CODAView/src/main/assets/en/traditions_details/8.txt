In CODA, no one is paid to share experience, strength and hope, whether at meetings, as sponsors, or in any other twelve Step related activity. Professionals attending CODA meetings do so as members only, and do not use the Fellowship to further their business interests. Our service centres may hire member or non-member employees for business needs. We may reimburse service related expenses, when financially possible, to those who sewn the Fellowship.
