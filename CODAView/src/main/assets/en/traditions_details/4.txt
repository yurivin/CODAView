As long as a group follows the twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and reads the preamble and welcome as written, it may be recognized as a part of Co-Dependents Anonymous. After meeting these requirements, each group is responsible to its membership through the group conscience process. Each group has the obligation to make responsible decisions regarding its own affairs.
