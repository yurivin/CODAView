CoDA groups encourage responsibility in financial matters, such as paying for meeting room space, literature and refreshments. We maintain treasuries through voluntary contributions from members only. After the group meets its own needs and obligations, it is suggested that excess funds over and above a prudent reserve be distributed to the larger communities of CoDA: local, state, regional, provincial, national or international. Co-Dependents Anonymous does not accept large contributions from any individual, nor do we accept money, space or services from non-CoDA sources. Thus, we maintain accountability and independence.
