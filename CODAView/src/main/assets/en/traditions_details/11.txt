CODA groups and members do not advertise or promote the Fellowship;  the  experience,  strength  and  hope  of  members speaks  for  itself.  Our  announcements  to  the  public  supply necessary  meeting  information,  such  as  time,  day  and location.  Relations  with  the  media  are  handled  through appropriate  service  entities,  such  as  public  information committees  or  Fellowship  Sluices.  In  meetings,  we  identify ourselves  by  first  names  only.  However  members  may choose to shed their anonymity at a personal level. We make our  meeting  information  and  literature  available  to  the community.
