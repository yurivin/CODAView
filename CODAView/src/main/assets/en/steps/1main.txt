WHO cares to admit complete defeat? Practically no one, of course. Every natural instinct cries out against the idea of personal powerlessness. It is truly awful to admit that, some feelings, we have warped our minds into such an obsession for destructive relationships that only an act of providence can remove it from us. No other kind of bankruptcy is like this one for us. Codependent relationships, and all will to resist its demands. Once this stark fact is accepted, our bankruptcy as going human concerns is complete. But upon entering CODA we soon take quite another view of this absolute humiliation. We perceive that only through utter defeat are we able to take our first steps toward liberation and strength. Our admissions of personal powerlessness finally turn out to be firm bedrock upon which happy and purposeful lives may be built.
