We know that little good can come to any codependent who joins CODA unless he has first accepted his devastating weakness and all its consequences. Until he so humbles himself, his emotional sobriety—if any—will be precarious. Of real happiness he will find none at all. Proved beyond doubt by an immense experience, this is one of the facts of CODA life. The principle that we shall find no enduring strength until we first admit complete defeat is the main taproot from which our whole Society has sprung and flowered. When first challenged to admit defeat, most of us revolted. We had approached CODA expecting to be taught self-confidence. Then we had been told that so far as emotional problems is concerned, self-confidence was no good whatever; in fact, it was a total liability. Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a mental obsession so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it. There was, they said, no such thing as the personal conquest of this compulsion by the unaided will. Relentlessly deepening our dilemma, our sponsors pointed out our increasing sensitivity to codependency. The tyrant codependent feelings wielded a double-edged sword over us: first we were smitten by an insane urge that condemned us to follow these fillings, and then by an allergy of the body that insured we would ultimately destroy ourselves in the process. Few indeed were those who, so assailed, had ever won through in singlehanded combat. It was a statistical fact that codependents almost never recovered on their own resources.
