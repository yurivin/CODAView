Many of us have someone in our life who challenges our ability to trust and care for ourselves. When we hear that person's voice or are in his or her presence, we may forget all we know about what is real, about how to own our power, about how to be direct, about what we know and believe to be true, about how important we are. We give up our power to that person. The child in us gets hooked with a mixture of powerful feelings—love, fear, or anger. We may feel trapped, helpless, or so attracted that we can't think straight. There may be a powerful tug­of­war going between feelings of anger and our need to be loved and accepted, or between our head and our heart. We may be so enamored or intimidated that we revert to our belief that we can't react or respond to this person any differently. We get hooked. We don't have to stay under a spell. We start by becoming aware of the people who hook us, and then accepting that. We can force ourselves through the motions of reacting differently to that person, even if that new reaction is awkward and uncomfortable. Search out our motivations. Are we somehow trying to control or influence the other person? We cannot change the other person, but we can stop playing our part of the game. One good way to do this is by detaching and letting go of any need to control.The next step is learning to own our power to take care of ourselves, to be who we are free from their influence. We can learn to own our power with difficult people. It may not happen overnight, but we can begin, today, to change our self­ defeating reactions to the people who have hooked us.
