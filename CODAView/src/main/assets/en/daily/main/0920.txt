In recovery, we're learning to let ourselves go! We're learning to be spontaneous. Spontaneity may frighten some of us. We may be afraid of the loss of control involved with spontaneity. We may still be operating under the codependent rules that prohibit spontaneity: be good; be right; be perfect; be strong; don't have fun; and always be in control. We may associate spontaneity with acting out in an addictive, compulsive, self­destructive, or irresponsible manner. That's not what we're talking about in recovery. Positive spontaneity involves freely expressing who we are—in a way that is fun, healthy, doesn't hurt us, and doesn't infringe on the rights of others. We learn to be spontaneous and free as we grow in selfawareness and self­esteem. Spontaneity emerges as our confidence and trust in ourselves increase, and we become more secure in our ability to maintain healthy boundaries. Being spontaneous is connected to our ability to play and to achieve intimacy. For all those desirable acts, we need to be able to let go of our need to control ourselves and others, and fully and freely enter into the present moment. Let go of your tight rein on yourself. So what if you make a mistake? So what if you're wrong? Relish your imperfections. Let yourself be a little needy, a little vulnerable. Take a risk! We can be spontaneous without hurting ourselves, or others. In fact, everyone will benefit by our spontaneity.
