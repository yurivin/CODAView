Let yourself feel the good feelings too. Yes, sometimes good feelings can be as distracting as the painful, more difficult ones. Yes, good feelings can be anxiety producing to those of us unaccustomed to them. But go ahead and feel the good feelings anyway. Feel and accept the joy. The love. The warmth. The excitement. The pleasure. The satisfaction. The elation. The tenderness. The comfort. Let yourself feel the victory, the delight. Let yourself feel cared for. Let yourself feel respected, important, and special. These are only feelings, but they feel good. They are full of positive, upbeat energy—and we deserve to feel that when it comes our way. We don't have to repress. We don't have to talk ourselves out of feeling good—not for a moment. If we feel it, it's ours for the moment. Own it. If it's good, enjoy it.
