So much talk about a Higher Power, God as we understand God. So much joy as we come to understand Him. Spirituality and spiritual growth are the foundations of change. Recovery from codependency is not a do­it­yourself task. Is God a relentless taskmaster? A hard­hearted, shaming wizard with tricks up the sleeve? Is God deaf? Uncaring? Haphazard? Unforgiving? No. A loving God, a caring God. That is the God of our recovery. No more pain than is necessary for usefulness, healing, and cleansing. As much goodness and joy as our heart can hold, as soon as our heart is healed, open, and ready to receive. God: approving, accepting, instantly forgiving. God has planned little gifts along the way to brighten our day, and sometimes big, delightful surprises—perfectly timed, perfect for us. A Master Artist, God will weave together all our joy, sadness, and experience to create a portrait of our life with depth, beauty, sensitivity, color, humor, and feeling. God as we understand Him: A loving God. The God of our recovery.
