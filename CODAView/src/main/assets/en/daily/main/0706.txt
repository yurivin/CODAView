In the Sixth and Seventh Steps of the program, we become willing to let go of our defects of character—issues, behaviors, old feelings, unresolved grief, and beliefs that are blocking us from the joy that is ours. Then we ask God to take them from us. Isn't that simple? We don't have to contort ourselves to make ourselves change. We don't have to force change. For once, we don't have to ''do it ourselves." All we have to do is strive for an attitude of willingness and humility. All we have to do is ask God for what we want and need, and then trust God to do for us that which we cannot do and do not have to do for ourselves. We do not have to watch with bated breath for how and when we shall change. This is not a self­help program. In this miraculous and effective program that has brought about recovery and change for millions, we become changed by working the Steps.
