We cannot afford to allow our focus in life to be money. That will not lead us into the abundance we're seeking. Usually, it will not even lead to financial stability. Money is important. We deserve to be paid what we're worth. We will be paid what we're worth when we believe we deserve to be. But often our plans fail when our primary consideration is money. What do we really want to do? What do we feel led to do? What are our instincts telling us? What do we feel guided to do? What are we excited about doing? Seek to find a way to do that, without worrying about the money. Consider the financial aspects. Set boundaries about what you need to be paid. Be reasonable. Expect to start at the bottom, and work up. But if you feel led toward a job, go for it. Is there something we truly don't want to do, something that goes against our grain, but we are trying to force ourselves into it "for the money"? Usually, that's a behavior that backfires. It doesn't work. We make ourselves miserable, and the money usually goes wrong too. I have learned that when I am true to myself about work and what I need to be doing, the money will follow. Sometimes it's not as much as I wantÍ¾ sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, and it's more. But I'm content, and I have enough. Money is a consideration, but it cannot be our primary consideration if we are seeking spiritual security and peace of mind.
