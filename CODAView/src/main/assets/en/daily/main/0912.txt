Recovery is a process. It is a gradual process, a healing process, and a spiritual process—a journey rather than a destination. Just as codependency takes on a life of its own and is progressive, so recovery progresses. One thing leads to another and things—as well as us—get better. We can relax, do our part, and let the rest happen.
