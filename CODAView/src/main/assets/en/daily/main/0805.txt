Sometimes, our life and history may be so full of pain that we think it totally unfair that we have to grow up now and be financially responsible for ourselves. The feeling is understandable; the attitude is not healthy. Many people in recovery may believe that certain people in particular, and life in general, owe them a living after what they've been through. To feel good about ourselves, to find the emotional peace and freedom we're seeking in recovery, we need healthy boundaries about money—what we give to others, and what we allow ourselves to receive from others. Do we feel that others owe us money because we cannot take care of ourselves? Do we believe others owe us because we do not have as much money as they do? Do we consciously or subconsciously believe that they ''owe" us money because of emotional pain we suffered as a result of our relationship with them or another person? Punitive damages are awarded in court, but not in recovery. Unhealthy boundaries about what we allow ourselves to receive from others will not lead to healthy relationships with others or ourselves. Test by looking within. The key is our attitude. The issue is boundaries about receiving money. Become willing to meet the challenge of taking responsibility for yourself.
