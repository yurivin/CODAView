There is a difference between owning our power to take care of ourselves, as part of God's will for our life, and self­will. There is a difference between self­care and self­seeking. And our behaviors are not as much subject to criticism as are the motives underlying them. There is a harmonic, gentle, timely feeling to owning our power, to self­care, and to acts with healthy motives that are not present in self­will and self­seeking. We will learn discernment. But we will not always know the difference. Sometimes, we will feel guilty and anxious with no need. We may be surprised at the loving way God wants us to treat ourselves. We can trust that self­care is always appropriate. We want to be free of self­will and self­seeking, but we are always free to take care of ourselves.
