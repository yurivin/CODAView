When we are soul足searching, be it for the smaller or larger decisions we face during the day, we can learn to ask, is this good for me?. . . Is this what I really want?. . . .Is this what I need?. . . Does this direction feel right for me?. . .Or am I succumbing to the control and influence that I sometimes allow others to have over me? It is not unhealthy selfishness to question if something is good for us. That is an old way of thinking. To ask if something is good for us is a healthy behavior, not to be ashamed of, and will probably work out in the other person's best interests too. We shall not wander down a selfish path of self足indulgence by asking if a thing is good for us. We shall not stray from God's intended plan, God's highest good, by asking if a thing is good for us. By asking ourselves this simple question, we participate in directing our life toward the highest good and purpose余 we own our power to hold ourselves in self足esteem.
