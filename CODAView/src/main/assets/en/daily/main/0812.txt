Direct people are a joy to be around. We never have to guess what they're really thinking or feeling, because they're honest about their thoughts and openly express their feelings. We never have to wonder if they're with us because they want to be, or if they're there out of guilt and obligation. When they do something for us, we don't have to worry whether they'll end up resenting us because direct people generally do things that please themselves. We don't have to fuss about the status of our relationship because if we ask, they'll tell us. We don't have to worry if they're angry because they deal openly with their anger and resolve it quickly. We don't have to ponder whether they are talking about us behind our backs because if they have something to say, it will be said to us directly. We don't have to wonder if we can rely on them because direct people are trustworthy. Wouldn't it be nice if we were all direct?
