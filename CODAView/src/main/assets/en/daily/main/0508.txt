Often, our instinctive reaction to something we want or need is, ''No! I can't afford it!'' The question we can learn to ask ourselves is, "But, can I?"nMany of us have learned to habitually deprive ourselves of anything we might want, and often things we need. Sometimes, we can misuse the concept of gratitude to keep ourselves unnecessarily deprived. Gratitude for what we have is an important recovery concept. So is believing we deserve the best and making an effort to stop depriving ourselves and start treating ourselves well. There is nothing wrong with buying ourselves what we want when we can afford to do that. Learn to trust and listen to yourself about what you want. There's nothing wrong with buying yourself a treat, buying yourself something new. There are times when it is good to wait. There are times when we legitimately cannot afford a luxury. But there are many times when we can.
