We have choices, more choices than we let ourselves see. We may feel trapped in our relationships, our jobs, our life. We may feel locked into behaviorsâ€”such as caretaking or controlling. Feeling trapped is a symptom of codependency. When we hear ourselves say, "I have to take care of this person. . . ." "I have to say yes. . . ." "I have to try to control that person. . . ." "I have to behave this way, think this way, feel this way. . . ." we can know we are choosing not to see choices. That sense of being trapped is an illusion. We are not controlled by circumstances, our past, the expectations of others, or our unhealthy expectations for ourselves. We can choose what feels right for us, without guilt. We have options. Recovery is not about behaving perfectly or according to anyone else's rules. More than anything else, recovery is about knowing we have choices and giving ourselves the freedom to choose.
