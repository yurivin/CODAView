Don't panic! If panic strikes, we do not have to allow it to control our behaviors. Behaviors controlled by panic tend to be self­defeating. No matter what the situation or circumstance, panic is usually not a good foundation. No matter what the situation or circumstance, we usually have at least a moment to breathe deeply and restore our serenity and peace. We don't have to do more than we can reasonably do ever! We don't have to do something we absolutely cannot do or cannot learn to do! This program, this healthy way of life we are seeking, is built on a foundation of peace and quiet confidence—in ourselves, in our Higher Power, in the recovery process. Do not panic. That takes us away from the path. Relax. Breathe deeply. Let peace flow through our body and mind. From this base, our Source shall supply the necessary resources.
