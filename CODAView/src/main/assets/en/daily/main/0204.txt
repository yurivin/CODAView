What a journey! This process of growth and change takes us along an everchanging road. Sometimes the way is hard and craggy. Sometimes we climb mountains. Sometimes we slide down the other side on a toboggan. Sometimes we rest. Sometimes we grope through the darkness. Sometimes we're blinded by sunlight. At times many may walk with us on the roadÍ¾ sometimes we feel nearly alone. Ever changing, always interesting, always leading someplace better, someplace good. What a journey!
