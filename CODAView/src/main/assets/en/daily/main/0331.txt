Taking financial responsibility for ourselves is part of recovery. Some of us may find ourselves in hard financial times for a variety of reasons. Our recovery concepts, including the Steps, work on money issues and restoring manageability to that area of our life. Make appropriate amendsâ€”even if that means tackling a $5,000 debt by sending in $5 a month. Start where you are, with what you've got. As with other issues, acceptance and gratitude turn what we have into more. Money issues are not a good place to act as if. Don't write checks until the money is in the bank. Don't spend money until you've got it in your hand. If there is too little money to survive, use the appropriate resources available without shame. Set goals. Believe you deserve the best, financially. Believe God cares about your finances. Let go of your fear, and trust.
