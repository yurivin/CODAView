Go back to the Steps. Go back to a Step. When we don't know what to do next, when we feel confused, upset, distraught, at the end of our rope, overwhelmed, full of selfÂ­will, rage, or despair, go back to the Steps. No matter what situation we are facing, working a Step will help. Focus on one, trust your instincts, and work it. What does it mean to work a Step? Think about it. Meditate on it. Instead of focusing on the confusion, the problems, or the situation causing our despair or rage, focus on the Step. Think about how that Step might apply. Hold on to it. Hang on as tightly as we hang on to our confusion or the problem. The Steps are a solution. They work. We can trust them to work. We can trust where the Steps will lead us. When we don't know what step to take next, take one of the Twelve.
