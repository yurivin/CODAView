Wait until the time is right. It is self­defeating to postpone or procrastinate; it is also self­defeating to act too soon, before the time is right. Sometimes, we panic and take action out of fear. Sometimes, we take untimely action for revenge or because we want to punish someone. We act or speak too soon as a way to control or force someone to action. Sometimes, we take action too soon to relieve feelings of discomfort or anxiety about how a situation will turn out. An action taken too soon can be as ineffective as one taken too late. It can backfire and cause more problems than it solves. Usually, when we wait until the time is right sometimes only a matter of minutes or hours—the discomfort dissolves, and we're empowered to accomplish what we need to do. In recovery, we are learning to be effective. Our answers will come. Our guidance will come. Pray. Trust. Wait. Let go. We are being led. We are being guided.
