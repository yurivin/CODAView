Do not be in such a hurry to move on. Relax. Breathe deeply. Be. Be in harmony today. Be open. There is beauty around and in us today. There is purpose and meaning in today. There is importance in today—not so much in what happens to us, but in how we respond. Let today happen. We learn our lessons, we work things out, we change in a simple fashion: by living our life fully today. Do not worry about tomorrow's feelings, problems, or gifts. Do not worry about whether we can trust ourselves, life, or our Higher Power tomorrow. Everything we need today shall be given to us. That is a promise—from God, from the Universe. Feel today's feelings. Solve today's problems. Enjoy today's gifts. Trust yourself, life, and your Higher Power today. Acquire the art of living fully today. Absorb the lessons, the healing, the beauty, the love available to us today. Do not be in such a rush to move on. There is no hurry. We cannot escape; we only postpone. Let the feelings go; breathe in peace and healing. Do not be in such a hurry to move on.
