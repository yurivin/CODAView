We come to believe in a better life through the powerful gift of other people—hearing them, seeing them, watching the gift of recovery at work in their lives. There is a Power greater than ourselves. There is real hope now that things can and will be different and better for us and our life. We are not in a "do it ourselves" program. We do not have to exert willpower to change. We do not have to force our recovery to happen. We do not have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps just so we believe that there is a Power greater than ourselves—one who will get the job done in our life. This Power will do for us what your greatest and most diligent efforts could not accomplish. Our Higher Power will restore us to a sane and beneficial life. All we do is believe. Look. Watch. See the people around you. See the healing they have found. Then discover your own faith, your own belief, your own healing.
