". . .a Power greater than ourselves. . . ." "God as we understood Him." These words introduce spirituality in the Twelve Steps. They are the first two references to God, and they are worded that way for a reason. We each have the freedom to define, and understand, our Higher Power—God—as we choose. That means we do not bring our religious affiliation into our recovery groups. It means that we do not try to impose our religious beliefs, or our understanding of God, on anyone else. We do not use our groups or meetings as a soap box to gain religious converts. We do not try to force the particulars of our religious beliefs on others. We give ourselves, and each person, the right to a personal understanding of a Higher Power.
