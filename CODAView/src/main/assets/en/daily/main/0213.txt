What a great gift we've been givenâ€”ourselves. To listen to ourselves, to trust instinct and intuition, is to pay tribute to that gift. What a disservice not to heed the leadings and leanings that so naturally arise from within. When will we learn that these leadings and leanings draw us into God's rich plan for us? We will learn. We will learn by listening, trusting, and following through. What is it time to do?. . . What do I need to do to take care of myself?. . What am I being led to do?. . . What do I know? Listen, and we will know. Listen to the voice within.
