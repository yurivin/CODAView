This prayer is based on a section of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous: Thank you for keeping me straight yesterday. Please help me stay straight today. For the next twenty­four hours, I pray for knowledge of Your will for me only, and the power to carry that through. Please free my thinking of self­will, self­seeking, dishonesty, and wrong motives. Send me the right thought, word, or action. Show me what my next step should be. In times of doubt and indecision, please send Your inspiration and guidance. I ask that You might help me work through all my problems, to Your glory and honor. This prayer is a recovery prayer. It can take us through any situation. In the days ahead, well explore the ideas in it. If we pray this prayer, we can trust it has been answered with a yes.
