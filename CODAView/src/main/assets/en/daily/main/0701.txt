Here is an exercise: Today, let someone give to you. Let someone do something nice for you. Let someone give you a compliment or tell you something good about yourself. Let someone help you. Then, stand there and take it. Take it in. Feel it. Know that you are worthy and deserving. Do not apologize. Do not say, ''You shouldn't have." Do not feel guilty, afraid, ashamed, and panicky. Do not immediately try to give something back. Just say, "Thank you."
