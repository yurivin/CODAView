Ultimately, to grieve our losses means to surrender to our feelings. So many of us have lost so much, have said so many goodÂ­byes, have been through so many changes. We may want to hold back the tides of change, not because the change isn't good, but because we have had so much change, so much loss. Sometimes, when we are in the midst of pain and grief, we become shortsighted, like members of a tribe described in the movie Out of Africa. "If you put them in prison," one character said, describing this tribe, "they die." "Why?" asked another character. "Because they can't grasp the idea that they'll be let out one day. They think it's permanent, so they die. "Many of us have so much grief to get through. Sometimes we begin to believe grief, or pain, is a permanent condition. The pain will stop. Once felt and released, our feelings will bring us to a better place than where we started. Feeling our feelings, instead of denying or minimizing them, is how we heal from our past and move forward into a better future. Feeling our feelings is how we let go. It may hurt for a moment, but peace and acceptance are on the other side. So is a new beginning.
