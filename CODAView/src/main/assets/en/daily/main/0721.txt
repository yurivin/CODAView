We are not always clear about what we are experiencing, or why. In the midst of grief, transition, transformation, learning, healing, or discipline—it's difficult to have perspective. That's because we have not learned the lesson yet. We are in the midst of it. The gift of clarity has not yet arrived. Our need to control can manifest itself as a need to know exactly what's going on. We cannot always know. Sometimes, we need to let ourselves be and trust that clarity will come later, in retrospect. If we are confused, that is what we are supposed to be. The confusion is temporary. We shall see. The lesson, the purpose, shall reveal itself—in time, in its own time. It will all make perfect sense—later.
