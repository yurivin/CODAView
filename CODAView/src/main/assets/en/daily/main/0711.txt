No request is too large; none too small or insignificant. How often we limit God by not bringing to God everything we want and need. Do we need help getting our balance? Getting through the day? Do we need help in a particular relationship? With a particular character defect? Attaining a character asset? Do we need help making progress on a particular task that is challenging us? Do we need help with a feeling? Do we want to change a self­defeating belief that has been challenging us? Do we need information, an insight? Support? A friend? Is there something in God's Universe that would really bring us joy? We can ask for it. We can ask God for whatever we want. Put the request in God's hands, trusting it has been heard, then let it go. Leave the decision to God. Asking for what we want and need is taking care of ourselves. Trust that the Higher Power to whom we have turned over our life and will really does care about us and about what we want and need.
