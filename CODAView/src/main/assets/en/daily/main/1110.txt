What are our beliefs about money? Do we believe that money is evil and wrong? Money is neither. It is a commodity on earth, a necessity. It is what people need to purchase many of their basic needs, as well as luxuries and treats余 it is one way they are rewarded for their work. Loving money, however, can be as self足defeating as loving any other commodity. We can become obsessed with money余 we can use it as an escape from relationships and feelings余 we can use it compulsively to gain a temporary sense of power. Money is simply money. Do we believe there's a scarcity of money? Many of us grew up with deprived thinking concerning money: There's not enough. There will never be enough. If we get a little, we may guard it and hoard it because there's no more. Money is not in short supply. We do not have to waste our energy resenting those who have enough. There is plenty of money here on earth. How much do we believe we deserve? Many of us are limiting ourselves by what we believe we deserve. Money is not evil. There is no scarcity, except in our mind and attitudes. And what we believe we deserve will be about what we shall receive. We can change our beliefs through affirmations, by setting goals, by starting where we are, and working slowly forward to where we want to be.
