It's okay to be angry, but it isn't healthy to be resentful. Regardless of what we learned as children, no matter what we saw role­modeled, we can learn to deal with our anger in ways that are healthy for us and for those around us. We can have our angry feelings. We can connect with them, own them, feel them, express them, release them, and be done with them. We can learn to listen to what anger is telling us about what we want and need in order to take care of ourselves. Sometimes we can even indulge in angry feelings that aren't justified. Feelings are just feelings; there is no morality in the feeling, only in our behavior. We can feel Angry without hurting or abusing others or ourselves. We can learn to deal with anger in ways that benefit our relationships instead of ways that harm them. If we don't feel our angry feelings today, we will need to face them tomorrow.
