Often, the spiritual and recovery lessons we're learning at work reflect the lessons we're learning in other areas of our life. Often, the systems we're attracted to in our working life are similar to the systems in which we find ourselves living and loving. Those are the systems that reflect our issues and can help us learn our lessons. Are we slowly learning to trust ourselves at work? How about at home? Are we slowly learning to take care of ourselves at work? How about at home? Are we slowly learning boundaries and self­esteem, overcoming fear, and dealing with feelings? If we search back over our work history, we will probably see that it is a mirror of our issues, our growth. It most likely is now too. For today, we can believe that we are right where we need to be—at home and at work.
