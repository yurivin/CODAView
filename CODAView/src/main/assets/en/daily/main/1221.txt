Strive for balanced expectations of others. Strive for healthy tolerance.  In the past, we may have tolerated too much or too little. We may have expected too much or too little. We may swing from tolerating abuse, mistreatment, and deception to refusing to tolerate normal, human, imperfect behaviors from people. Although it's preferable not to remain in either extreme too long, that is how people change—real people who struggle imperfectly toward better lives, improved relationships, and more effective relationship behaviors.n But if we are open to ourselves and to the recovery process, we will, at some time, begin another transition: it becomes time to move away from extremes, toward balance.bWe can trust ourselves and the recovery process to bring us to a balanced place of tolerance, giving, understanding, and expectations—of ourselves and others. We can each find our own path to balance as we begin and continue recovery.
