Experiment. Try something new. Try stepping out. We have been held back too long. We have held ourselves back too long. As children, many of us were deprived of the right to experiment. Many of us are depriving ourselves of the right to experiment and learn as adults. Now is the time to experiment. It is an important part of recovery. Let yourself try things. Let yourself try something new. Yes, you will make mistakes. But from those mistakes, you can learn what your values are. Some things we just won't like. That's good. Then well know a little more about who we are and what we don't like. Some things we will like. They will work with our values. They will work with who we are, and we will discover something important and life足enriching. There is a quiet time in recovery, a time to stand still and heal, a time to give ourselves a cooling足off time. This is a time of introspection and healing. It is an important time. We deal with our issues. There also comes a time when it is equally important to experiment, to begin to "test the water." Recovery does not equal abstention from life. Recovery means learning to live and learning to live fully. Recovery means exploration, investigation, experimentation. Recovery means being done with the rigid, shame足based rules from the past, and formulating healthy values based on self足love, love for others, and living in harmony with this world. Experiment. Try something new. Maybe you won't like it. Maybe youll make a mistake. But maybe you will like it, and maybe you'll discover something you love.
