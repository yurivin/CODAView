This verse has helped me many times. It has helped me when I have wondered where my next friend, bit of wisdom, insight, or meal was coming from. Everything I need today shall be supplied to me. People, jobs, what we have at our immediate disposal, are not our source. We have tapped into a Greater Source, a source of infinite and immediate supply: God and His Universe. Our task is to allow ourselves to come into harmony with our Source. Our task is to believe in, and look to, our true Source. Our task is to release fear, negative thinking, limitations, and short­supply thinking. Everything we need shall be provided to us. Let it become a natural response to all situations, and all situations of need. Reject fear. Reject short­supply and limited thinking notions. Be open to abundance. Cherish need because it is part of our relationship to God and His Universe. God has planned to meet our every need, has created the need within us, so God can supply. No need is too small or too great. If we care and value our need, God will too. Our part is taking responsibility for owning the need. Our part is giving the need to the Universe. Our part is letting go, in faith. Our part is giving God permission to meet our needs by believing we deserve to have our needs—and wants—met. Our part is healthy giving, not out of caretaking, guilt, obligation, and codependency, but out of a healthy relationship with ourselves, God, and all of God's creations. Our part is simply to be who we are, and love being that.
