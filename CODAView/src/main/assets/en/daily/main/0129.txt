We don't have to stay stuck in our misery and discomfort. An immediate option is available that will help us feel better: go to a meeting, a Twelve Step support group. Why resist what can help us feel better? Why sit in our obsession or depression when attending a meeting—even if that means an extra meeting—would help us feel better? Too busy? There are 168 hours in each week. Taking 1 or 2 hours a week for a meeting can maximize the potential of the remaining 166 hours. If we get into our "codependent stuff," we can easily spend a majority of our waking hours obsessing, sitting and doing nothing, lying in bed and feeling depressed, or chasing after other people's needs. Not taking those 2 hours for a meeting can cause us to waste the remaining hours. Too tired? There is nothing as invigorating as getting back on track. Going to a meeting can accomplish that.
