Boundaries are vital to recovery. Having and setting healthy limits is connected to all phases of recovery: growing in selfÂ­ esteem, dealing with feelings, and learning to really love and value ourselves. Boundaries emerge from deep within. They are connected to letting go of guilt and shame, and to changing our beliefs about what we deserve. As our thinking about this becomes clearer, so will our boundaries. Boundaries are also connected to a Higher Timing than our own. We'll set a limit when we're ready, and not a moment before. So will others. There's something magical about reaching that point of becoming ready to set a limit. We know we mean what we say? others take us seriously too. Things change, not because we're controlling others, but because we've changed.
