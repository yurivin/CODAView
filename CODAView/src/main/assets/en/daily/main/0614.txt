When the time is right, child. When the time is right. How often have we heard those words—from a friend, a sponsor, our Higher Power? We want things so badly—that job, that check, a relationship, a possession. We want our life to change. So we wait, sometimes patiently, sometimes anxiously, wondering all the while: When will the future bring me what I long for? Will I be happy then? We try to predict, circling dates on the calendar, asking questions. We forget that we don't hold the answers. The answers come from God. If we listen closely, well hear them. When the time is right, child. When the time is right. Be happy now.
