We don't need to limit an inventory of ourselves to the negatives. Focusing only on what's wrong is a core issue in our codependency. Honestly, fearlessly, ask: "What's right with me? What are my good points?" "Am I a loving, caring, nurturing person?" We may have neglected to love ourselves in the process of caring for others, but nurturing is an asset. "Is there something I do particularly well?" "Do I have a strong faith?" "Am I good at being there for others?" "Am I good as part of a team, or as a leader?'' ''Do I have a way with words or with emotions?" "Do I have a sense of humor?" "Do I brighten people up?" "Am I good at comforting others?" "Do I have an ability to make something good out of barely nothing at all?" "Do I see the best in people?" These are character assets. We may have gone to an extreme with these, but that's okay. We are now on our way to finding balance. Recovery is not about eliminating our personality. Recovery aims at changing, accepting, working around, or transforming our negatives, and building on our positives. We all have assetsÍ¾ we only need to focus on them, empower them, and draw them out in ourselves. Codependents are some of the most loving, caring people around. Now, we're learning to give some of that concern and nurturing to ourselves.
