Compulsive buying or overspending may give us a temporary feeling of power or satisfaction, but like other out­of­control behaviors, it has predictable negative consequences. Underspending can leave us feeling victimized too. There is a difference between responsible spending and martyred deprivation. There is a difference between treating ourselves well financially and overspending. We can learn to discern that difference. We can develop responsible spending habits that reflect high self­esteem and love for ourselves.
