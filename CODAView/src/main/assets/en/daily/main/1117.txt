It's important to let ourselves grieve as a passage between yesterday and tomorrow. But we do not have to be controlled unduly by our grief, or our pain. There are times when we have grieved, surrendered to the heaviness, tiredness, and weariness of a circumstance long enough. It becomes time to break out. It comes time to take action. We will know when it's time to break the routine of grieving. There will be signs within and around us. We will become tired of the heaviness. An idea will occurÍ¾ an opportunity will present itself. We may think: No. Too much effort. . . . Do it anyway. Try something. Reach out. Stretch. Do something unusual, something different, something special. A new activity may help trigger the transformation process. Stay up two hours later than usual! Make an appointment to do something for yourself that is different from what you usually do. Visit someone you haven't seen in years. Do something to encourage and help the new energy coming your way. We may not feel like breaking out of grief. It may feel safer, easier, to remain in our cocoon. Begin pushing out anyway. Test the walls of your cocoon. Push. Push a little harder. It may be time to emerge.
