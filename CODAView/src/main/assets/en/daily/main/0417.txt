We often refer to recovery from codependency and adult child issues as ''self­care.'' Self­care is not, as some may think, a spin­off of the "me generation." It isn't self­indulgence. It isn't selfishness—in the negative interpretation of that word. We're learning to take care of ourselves, instead of obsessively focusing on another person. We're learning self­responsibility, instead of feeling excessively responsible for others. Self­care also means tending to our true responsibilities to others; we do this better when we're not feeling overly responsible. Self­care sometimes means, "me first," but usually, "me too." It means we are responsible for ourselves and can choose to no longer be victims. Self­care means learning to love the person we're responsible for taking care of—ourselves. We do not do this to hibernate in a cocoon of isolation and self­indulgence; we do it so we can better love others, and learn to let them love us. Self­care isn't selfish; it's self­esteem.
