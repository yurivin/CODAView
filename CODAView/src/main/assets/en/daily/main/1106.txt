Do something fun today. If you're relaxing, let yourself relax, without guilt, without worrying about the work that is undone. If you're with loved ones, let yourself love them, and let them love you. Let yourself feel close. Let yourself enjoy your work, for that can be pleasurable too. If you're doing something fun, let yourself enjoy it. What would feel good? What would you enjoy? Is there a positive pleasure available? Indulge. Recovery is not solely about stopping the pain. Recovery is about learning to make ourselves feel betterÍ¾ then it's about making ourselves feel good. Enjoy your day.
