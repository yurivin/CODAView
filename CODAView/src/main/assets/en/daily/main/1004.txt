Sometimes, there is not enough money to make ends meet, much less afford any luxuries. People may tell us to do a budget, and we chuckle. The expenses we need to pay for survival surpass the income. We look at the situation, shake our heads, and say, ''No way.'' Many of us have had to live through these situations. This is not the time to panic; this is not the time to despair. Panic and desperation will lead to bad judgment and desperate moves. This is the time to substitute faith for fear. This is the time to trust God to meet our needs. Take life one day and one need at a time. Use your survival skills positively. Know your possibilities are not limited by the past or by your present circumstances. Examine any blocks that might be stopping the flow of money in your life. Do you have an attitude, an issue, a lesson that might be yours to change or learn? Maybe the lesson is a simple one of faith. In Biblical times, it is said that Jesus walked on the water. It is said His followers could, too, but the moment they let fear take over, they sank. During financial hard times, we can learn to "walk on water" with money issues. If we make out a budget, and there's not enough money to survive and pay legitimate expenses, do your best, then let go. Trust your Source to supply your needs. If an emergency arises, and there is no cash to meet the need, look beyond your wallet. Look to your source. Claim a Divine supply, an unlimited supply, for all that you need. Do your part. Strive for an attitude of financial responsibility in thought and action. Ask for Divine Wisdom. Listen to God's leadings. Then let go of your fears and your need to control. We know that money is a necessary part of being alive and living; so does our Higher Power.
