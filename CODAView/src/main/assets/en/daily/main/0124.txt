One of the greatest gifts we can give is an open, loving heart. And holding on to negative feelings from past relationships is our greatest barrier to that gift. Most of us have had relationships that have ended. When we examine these relationships, we need to clear the emotional slate. Are we holding on to anger or resentments? Are we still feeling victimized? Are we living with the self­defeating beliefs that may be attached to these relationships—Women can't be trusted. . . . Bosses use people. . . .Then is no such thing as a good relationship. . . . Let go of all that may be blocking your relationships today. With great certainty, we can know that old feelings and self­defeating beliefs will block us today from giving and getting the love we desire. We can clear the slate of the past. It begins with awareness, honesty, and openness. The process is complete when we reach a state of acceptance and peace toward all from our past.
