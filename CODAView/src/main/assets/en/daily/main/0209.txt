Gentle people, gentle souls, go in love. Yes, at times we need to be firm, assertive: those times when we change, when we acquire a new behavior, when we need to convince others and ourselves we have rights. Those times are not permanent. We may need to get angry to make a decision or set a boundary, but we can't afford to stay resentful. It is difficult to have compassion for one who is victimizing us, but once we've removed ourselves as victims, we can find compassion. Our path, our way, is a gentle one, walked in loveâ€”love for self, love for others. Set boundaries. Detach. Take care of ourselves. And as quickly as possible, do those things in love.
