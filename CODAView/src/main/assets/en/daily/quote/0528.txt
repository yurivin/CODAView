A married woman who had recently joined Al­Anon called me one afternoon. She worked part­time as a registered nurse, had assumed all the responsibilities for raising her two
children, and did all the household chores, including repairs and finances. "I want to separate from my husband," she sobbed. "I can't stand him or his abuse any longer. But tell
me, please tell me," she said, "do you think I can take care of myself?"
