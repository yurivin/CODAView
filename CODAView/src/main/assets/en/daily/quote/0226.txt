I was furious when I found myself at my first Al­Anon meeting. It seemed so unfair that he had the problem and I had to go to a meeting. But by that time, I had nowhere left in the world to go with my pain. Now, I'm grateful for Al­Anon and my codependency recovery. Al­Anon keeps me on track; recovery has given me a life.
