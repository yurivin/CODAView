Today, I will pay attention to how I allow people to treat me, and how I feel about that. I will also watch how I treat others. I will not overreact by taking their issues too personally and too seriouslyÍ¾ I will not underreact by denying that certain behaviors are inappropriate and not acceptable to me.
