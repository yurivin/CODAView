Today, I will take a moment for meditation and prayer. I will decide when and how long to do it. I am a child and creation of Godâ€”a Higher Power who loves to listen and talk to me. God, help me let go of my fears about whether or not You hear and care. Help me know that You are there and that I am able to tap into the spiritual consciousness.
