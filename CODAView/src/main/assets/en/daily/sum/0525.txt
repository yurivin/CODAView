Today, I will work at loving myself. I will work as hard at loving myself as I have at not liking myself. Help me let go of self­hate and behaviors that reflect not liking myself. Help me replace those with behaviors that reflect self­love. Today, God, help me hold myself in high self­esteem. Help me know I'm lovable and capable of giving and receiving love.
