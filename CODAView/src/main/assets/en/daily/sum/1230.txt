Today, I will surrender to the laying of the foundation—the groundwork—in my life. If it is time to enjoy the placement of the finishing touches, I will surrender to that, and enjoy that too. I will remember to be grateful for a Higher Power that is a Master Builder and only has my best interests in mind, creating and constructing my life. I will be grateful for my Higher Power's care and attention to details in laying the foundation—even though I become impatient at times. I will stand in awe at the beauty of God's finished product.
