Today, God, help me let go of my need to control outcomes by influencing the beliefs of others. I will concentrate on accepting myself, rather than trying to prove something about myself. If I catchmyself in the codependent trap of trying to emphasize something about myself to another, I will ask myself if I need to convince myself of that point.
