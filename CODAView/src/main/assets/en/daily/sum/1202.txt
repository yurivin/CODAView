Today, I will force myself, if necessary, to live my own life. I will act in my own best interest, in a way that reflects selfÂ­love. If I have given power or control of my life to someone other than myself, and someone besides a Power greater than myself, I will take it back. I will begin acting in my own best interests, even if it feels awkward to do that.
