Today, I will focus on asking God to show me what He wants me to do. I will ask God for the power to do thatÍ¾ then I will go ahead and get the job done. God, help me let go of my fears about living life one day at a time. Help me trust that when life is lived simply and in trust, a beautiful mosaic called "my life" will be woven. I am being divinely led, guided, and cared for.
